    <h1> Artistry Alchemy </h1>
    <p> Welcome to Artistry Alchemy.</p>
    <p> Choose an art style and learn the skills needed to master it. </p>
    <p> REMINDER!!! </p>
    <p> Art is subjective, meaning everyone sees and feels it differently. There is no single 'right' way to make art, and you don't need to have one specific art style. What matters most is expressing your ideas and emotions in your own way. </p>
