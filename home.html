        <h2>What Is Artistry Alchemy?</h2>
        <p>Artistry Alchemy is a learning website that teaches artists the skills needed to create different art styles. Instead of guessing what to practice, we break styles into clear skills.</p>
        <h2>Who Is It For?</h2>
        <p>This site is for beginner and intermediate artists who want to improve their art and understand how different styles work.</p>
        <h2>Why Skills Matter?</h2>
        <p>Every art style is made up of skills like line work, anatomy, color, and shading. When you practice the right skills, your art improves faster.</p>
        <h2>How the Site Helps You</h2>
        <p>Artistry Alchemy shows you:</p>
        <p>"What skills a style uses"</p>
        <p>"Which skills matter most"</p>
        <p>"How to practice them"</p>
        <h2>What to Do Next</h2>
        <p>Start by choosing an art style from the Art Styles page.</p>
